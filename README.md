# Taskmaster Pro

## Page Description
This page is a functional task tracking application in a Kanban board style. APIs are used to enable functions and to provide custom fonts and icons.  This was modified from a base code provided as a project for a coding bootcamp.  The module focused on introducing jQuery, jQUeryUI, moment, Google Fonts, and Open Iconic as tools to build a web application. Responsive design is emphasized.
